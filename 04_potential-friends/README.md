Potential Friends
=================

Potential Friends exercise using Hadoop and Kotlin, explained in [Work in progress..]()

Given a file, or a list of files, where each line contains a pair of users in the format `user1,user2`,
indicating that `user1` is friend of `user2` and vice versa, the output of the MapReduce job should
contain the list of "potential" friends for each user, where two users are considered potential friends 
if they have at least a friend in common.
